            <h3>Exhaustion</h3>
            <p>Phantoms are disabled on SemiVanilla. Instead, to encourage sleep, players will experience <strong>Exhaustion</strong> - hearing random noises, occasional blindness, and nausea - if they don't sleep for extended periods of time.</p>
            <p>Phantom Membranes are still available on the server - we've added them to our custom lootchests!</p>

            <h3>Custom Recipes</h3>
            <p>There are several custom recipes on SemiVanilla. They can be used to craft items not normally craftable in survival, or convert items back into their raw materials.</p>
            <p>Custom recipes are unlocked in the recipe book just like vanilla recipes! You can see all available recipes to you in any crafting bench.</p>
            <p>To see all custom recipes, <a href="recipes/">click here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Trade System</h3>
            <p>Trades and job agreements are at-your-own-risk! Be sure to use the <strong>/trade</strong> UI when trading with other players to avoid scams. You can open this UI any time by <strong>shift + right click</strong> on another player.</p>

            <h3>Random Spawn</h3>
            <p>Every player spawns somewhere random within the overworld when they first join. This location is set as their spawnpoint - so they will always return there if they have no bed or respawn anchor.</p>
            <p>There is no spawn on SemiVanilla.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Custom Loot Tables</h3>
            <p>Custom loot tables have been added for every natural chest! We've significantly buffed the loot tables, making exploration worth it, and providing more access to items that are normally limited in survival.</p>
            <p>Natural chests also regenerate loot every 2-12 hours, so there's always something to find even if someone else has already been there!</p>
            <p style="color:#ff674d;">Please do not break natural chests if you don't need to! Leave them for someone else to discover.</p>

            <h3>ShulkerPacks</h3>
            <p>Shulkers can be opened while they are in your inventory! Simply right click on any shulker while in your inventory GUI.</p>
